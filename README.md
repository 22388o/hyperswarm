# hyperswarm

This is a WIP implementation of the next major release of Hyperswarm, which uses @hyperswarm/dht v5.

Remaining TODOs:
* Correctly limit server-side connections
* Make `announce` and `lookup` toggleable on `PeerDiscovery` objects
* (Optional) Support async firewalling
* Lots of testing + README updating
